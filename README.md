# Kickstarter Dashboard
I made a Kickstarter dashboard using data scraped by [WebRobots](https://webrobots.io/kickstarter-datasets/). I did extensive data wrangling [here](data-wrangling.Rmd) to prepare and clean the data for my dashboard. Then I built the dashboard using R Shiny. The dashboard includes a dynamically changing table that updates as you select filters. Click the link to try it out: https://ddachille23.shinyapps.io/kickstarter_dashboard_dan/
